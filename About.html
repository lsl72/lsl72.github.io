         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Hi there! Here is some information</p>
         <p> My real name is Laurent Steve Lopez but I go by Larry. I was born on September 28, 1998, in Miami, Fl. </p>
         <p> My dream was to some day just graduate and I didn't put to much mind to where I would graduate from because I come from a poor home where we aren't missing anything but also don't have for such things like an expensive school. I take "not getting my hopes up" very seriously because I don't like going through deisappointment.</p>
         <p>Fast forward to two years later, I'm on the verge of graduating from the Univerity of Miami with a Bachelor's Degree in Broadcast Journalism. These two years have been the toughest, hardest and most worthy years of my life. I gave everything I had, hoping it would work out and God helped through it all.</p>
