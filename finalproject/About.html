         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Hi, I'm Larry, here is some info about me</p>
         <p> My real name is Laurent Steve Lopez but I go by Larry. I was born on September 28, 1998, in Miami, Fl. Growing up I always wanted to do nursing or have a position in the medical field. I pursued it until my sophomore year in college. I graduated with my Associates in Arts at Miami-Dade College in 2019. I took a break and finally decided I wanted to be on Tv, so I decided to major in broadcast journalism.</p>
         <p> Within my gap year, I didn't know where I was going to go for school. My dream was to some day just graduate and I didn't put to much mind to where I would graduate from because I come from a poor home where we aren't missing anything but also don't have for such things like an expensive school. I take "not getting my hopes up" very seriously because I don't like going through deisappointment. I ended up applying to Florida International University (FIU) in which I got accepted.</p>
         <p> My bestfriend enouraged me to just apply to the University of Miami (which where I come from is a long shot) and after so much encouragement, I decided to just go with it. Again, I didn't get my hopes up because I know how it is. Two months after I applied, I was accepted into the University. I was unsure how much financial help I would recieve, which kept me from telling others about my acceptance. That all changed once I was blessed to recieve more help than I could've ever imagined.</p>
         <p>Fast forward to two years later, I'm on the verge of graduating from the Univerity of Miami with a Bachelor's Degree in Broadcast Journalism. These two years have been the toughest, hardest and most worthy years of my life. I gave everything I had, hoping it would work out and God helped through it all. I met great friends, professors and mentors along the way. I'm forever grateful to be where I am today.</p>
