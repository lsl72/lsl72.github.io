<h2>Demographic</h1>
<p class="smallfont">The increased use of family planning has lowered El Salvador's fertility rate, from nearly 6 children per woman in the 1970s to replacement level. A 2008 national family planning survey demonstrated that female sterilization remains the most common method in El Salvador. Its sterilization rate is within the highest in Latin America. The use of injectable strategies is growing. Fertility differences between the rich and the poor and the rural women are narrowing. Salvadorans fled during the civil war to the United States but also to Canada and other cities. Emigration to the United States has increased again in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of natural disasters and family reunification. At least 20% of El Salvador's population has been living abroad.</p>
